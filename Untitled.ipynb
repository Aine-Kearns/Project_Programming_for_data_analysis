    "### Project - Programming for Data Analysis\n",
    "For this project I have created a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon (what is that).  This was done by modelling and synthesising the data using Python, using the numpy.random package. <br>\n",
    "The project requirements ask the user to choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and with at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables. Additional requirements include <br>\n",
    "• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. <br>\n",
    "• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. <br>\n",
    "• Detail the research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook. <br>"
